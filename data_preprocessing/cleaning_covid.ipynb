It was extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \n","\n","The code below is performing a series of data cleaning and preprocessing steps on the dataframe named \"covid\". The first step was to convert the \"submission_date\" column to a datetime object, allowing for proper sorting and filtering by date. The dataframe was then sorted by date and state and only the columns \"submission_date\",\"state\",\"new_case\" were selected. The dataframe was then filtered to include only rows between the date range of \"2020-01-01\" and \"2021-03-31\", as this specific timeframe overlapped with the other datasets being used, making it possible to combine and analyze the datasets together. The dataframe was then pivoted by index \"date\" and columns \"state\". Missing values were filled with 0. The index of **the** dataframe was set as \"date\". After that, the number of states contained in the dataframe was tested; and as it included more than 50 values, any location that was not included in the 50 US states was dropped. Then the data was resampled to a monthly sum. Lastly, the dataframe was then melted by \"date\",var_name=\"state\",value_name=\"covid_cases\" . This allow for easy aggregation and filtering of the data by date and state. The last step was to check the shape of the dataframe to make sure we have the right amount of states and dates.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"i4IkKYz5x_HH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["covid =
