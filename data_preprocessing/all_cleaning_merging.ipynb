It was extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \n","\n","The code below is performing a series of data cleaning and preprocessing steps on the dataframe named \"covid\". The first step was to convert the \"submission_date\" column to a datetime object, allowing for proper sorting and filtering by date. The dataframe was then sorted by date and state and only the columns \"submission_date\",\"state\",\"new_case\" were selected. The dataframe was then filtered to include only rows between the date range of \"2020-01-01\" and \"2021-03-31\", as this specific timeframe overlapped with the other datasets being used, making it possible to combine and analyze the datasets together. The dataframe was then pivoted by index \"date\" and columns \"state\". Missing values were filled with 0. The index of **the** dataframe was set as \"date\". After that, the number of states contained in the dataframe was tested; and as it included more than 50 values, any location that was not included in the 50 US states was dropped. Then the data was resampled to a monthly sum. Lastly, the dataframe was then melted by \"date\",var_name=\"state\",value_name=\"covid_cases\" . This allow for easy aggregation and filtering of the data by date and state. The last step was to check the shape of the dataframe to make sure we have the right amount of states and dates.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"i4IkKYz5x_HH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["covid =

This file was pre-hydrated - see colab - in order to recover the location. The original dataset extracted from the paper originally contained 200M tweets. This dataset was reduced to 15M to maximise processing. \n","\n","This dataframe was filtered to only include rows where the value in the column \"BERT_label\" was equal to 1, indicating that the tweet was hateful. This considerably reduced the dataset as only hateful tweets were retained and tweets with a BERT label of 0, indicating no hate, were disregarded. The data was then grouped by date and location and the hate tweets counts were reset to the index. The \"created_at\" column was then converted to a datetime object and the data was sorted by date and location. The columns were then renamed to \"date\" and \"hate_tweets\" respectively, since the BERT label 1 were counted to represent the number of hate tweets per states over time rather than an indication of a hate tweet. \n","\n","The next step was to filter the \"user_location\" to only contain stattes. To do this, A list of all US state abbreviations was created and used to go through each location in the \"user_location\" column. Next, if a state abbreviation was present in a location, it was added to a new list called \"sts\". Once all locations were checked, the \"user_location\" column was replaced with the \"sts\" list containing only the state abbreviations found and the column was renamed to \"state\". The dataframe was then grouped by \"date\" and \"state\" and the sum was reset to the index. The dataframe was then pivoted by index \"date\" and columns \"state\" and filtered.
