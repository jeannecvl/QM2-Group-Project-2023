The incident date column was then converted to a datetime object and the data was grouped by state abbreviations and incident date, with values being summed, and the values sorted by incident date. The dataframe was then pivoted by index incident date and columns state abbreviations, filtering the total individual victims column and filling any missing values with 0. The index was reset and filtered to include only rows between the same date range as the covid cases dataset.
